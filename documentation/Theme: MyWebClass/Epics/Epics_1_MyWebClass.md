"Implement Google Analytics"

Description: 
- The implementation of Google Analytics involves adding a tracking code to a website to collect data about user 
behavior and website performance. This data can then be analyzed to gain insights into user preferences and behaviors, 
as well as to measure the effectiveness of marketing and advertising campaigns.

Goals: 
- To track the effectiveness of marketing and advertising campaigns
- To identify areas for improvement on the website based on user behavior data

User Stories:

and preferences, track the effectiveness of my marketing campaigns, and identify areas for improvement on my website.

Dependencies: 
- Access to the website code for adding the Google Analytics tracking code
- A Google Analytics account with the necessary permissions to track website data

Risks: 
- Implementation errors that could cause data inaccuracies
- Privacy concerns and compliance with relevant laws and regulations

Estimated Effort: 
- The effort required to implement Google Analytics will vary depending on the complexity of the website and the amount 
of customization needed. It could range from a few hours for a simple website to several weeks for a complex website.

Business Value: 
- The business value of implementing Google Analytics is significant as it provides insights into user behavior that 
can be used to improve the website's performance and increase user engagement. Additionally, it can help optimize 
marketing and advertising campaigns, resulting in a higher return on investment.

Priority: 
- The priority of implementing Google Analytics depends on the business objectives and goals. If data-driven decision 
making is a priority for the business, then it should be a high priority. However, if other initiatives have higher 
business value and impact, then it may be a lower priority.
