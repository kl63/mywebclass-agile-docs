"Improve App Performance"

Description: 
- The objective of this initiative is to optimize the performance of the mobile app to provide a faster and more 
responsive user experience. This will be achieved by identifying and resolving performance issues such as slow 
loading times, crashes, and high battery usage.

Goals: 
- Optimize the performance of the mobile app to provide a faster and more responsive user experience
- Improve app loading speed by 30%



Scope: 
- Focus on app loading speed, app crashes, and battery usage
- Prioritize based on user impact

Outcomes: 
- Faster app loading times
- More stable app with fewer crashes
- Reduced battery usage for improved battery life

Deliverables: 
- Performance analysis report with identified bottlenecks and recommendations
- Performance optimization plan with specific actions and timelines

Milestones: 
- Performance analysis report completed and reviewed by [date]
- Performance optimization plan finalized and approved by [date]

Constraints: 
- Limited time for implementation due to product launch schedule
- Limited access to user data and feedback for prioritization

Assumptions: 
- Performance optimization will not negatively impact other app features or functionality
- Users will prioritize app performance improvements over other feature requests

Risks: 
- Performance optimization may not be enough to meet user expectations or market standards
- Performance optimization may cause unintended consequences or new issues

Dependencies: 
- Performance analysis must be completed before optimization plan can be developed
- Quality assurance testing must be completed after app design and code updates


Team: 
- Performance Analyst: Conducts performance analysis and identifies bottlenecks
- Performance Engineer: Develops performance optimization plan and implements updates
- Quality Assurance Analyst: Conducts quality assurance testing and reports on resolved bugs and crashes
