"Minimize App Crashes and Bugs"

Description: 
- The objective of this initiative is to minimize the number of crashes and bugs in the mobile app by conducting 
thorough testing and implementing bug fixes and improvements to the app's code. This will be achieved by identifying 
and prioritizing the most critical bugs and crashes, conducting rigorous testing, and implementing improvements to the app's codebase to minimize the likelihood of future crashes and bugs.

Goals: 
- Improve user experience and satisfaction by reducing the number of crashes and bugs that users encounter while 
using the app

User Stories: 
- As a user, I want the app to be reliable and stable, so that I can use it consistently without experiencing any major 
issues or downtime.

Dependencies: 
- Access to thorough bug reports and crash logs
- Availability of resources for conducting thorough testing and implementing bug fixes

Risks: 
- Implementation of bug fixes may result in unintended changes to app functionality
- Limited access to user data and feedback may result in incorrect prioritization and less effective bug fixes

Estimated Effort: 
- Identifying and prioritizing critical bugs: 1-2 weeks
- Conducting rigorous testing: 2-4 weeks
- Implementing bug fixes and improvements: 4-8 weeks

Business Value: 
- Minimizing app crashes and bugs can improve user experience and satisfaction, which can lead to increased user 
- retention and loyalty, and ultimately, increased revenue.

Priority: 
- High priority, as app crashes and bugs can significantly impact user experience and can lead to user 
frustration and abandonment.
