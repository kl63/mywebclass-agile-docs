"Implement Design and Usability Improvements"

Description: 
- The objective of this initiative is to improve the design and usability of the mobile app by implementing improvements
to the app's user interface (UI) and user experience (UX). This will be achieved by conducting user research and 
gathering feedback, identifying areas of improvement, and implementing design and usability improvements to enhance 
the app's overall look, feel, and functionality.

Goals: 
- Increase app usage and revenue by improving the overall usability and functionality of the app

User Stories: 
- As a user, I want to be able to navigate the app easily and intuitively, without having to spend time learning how
to use it.

Dependencies: 
- User research and feedback gathering to identify areas of improvement
- Availability of resources for implementing design and usability improvements

Risks: 
- Implementation of design and usability improvements may require significant changes to the app's codebase and 
architecture, which can be time-consuming and resource-intensive
- Limited access to user data and feedback may result in incorrect prioritization and less effective improvements

Estimated Effort: 
- Conducting user research and feedback gathering: 2-4 weeks
- Implementing design and usability improvements: 4-8 weeks

Business Value: 
- Improving the app's design and usability can improve user experience and satisfaction, which can lead to increased 
user retention and loyalty, and ultimately, increased revenue.

Priority: 
- Medium priority, as design and usability improvements can have a significant 
impact on user experience, but may not be as critical as other initiatives, such as improving app loading speed or
minimizing app crashes and bugs.
