"Implement infrastructure automation"

Description: 
- Implement automation tools and techniques to reduce manual intervention in the deployment process, 
minimize errors, and accelerate deployment times.

Goals: 
- Write code that will do most of the work for us. 
- Decrease the chance of errors



Scope: 
- Automating the build process: This involves using tools and techniques to automate the creation of software builds, 
including compiling and packaging the software, creating binaries, and creating deployment artifacts.
- Automating the rollback process: This involves using tools and techniques to automate the rollback of software 
changes, in case there are issues during the deployment process or after the software has been released.

Outcomes: 
- involves using tools and techniques to automate the testing of software 
components, including unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests. This helps to ensure that 
software changes are properly tested before being deployed.
- Involves using tools and techniques to automate the rollback of software 
changes, in case there are issues during the deployment process or after the software has been released.

Deliverables: 
- Build automation scripts: These are scripts that automate the build process, including compiling and packaging the 
software, creating binaries, and creating deployment artifacts. These scripts should be easy to use and maintain, 
and should be documented to ensure that they can be easily understood by others.
- Automated testing scripts: These are scripts that automate the testing of the software builds, including unit tests, 
integration tests, and end-to-end tests. These scripts should be designed to catch any bugs or issues in the software 
builds and should be easy to run and maintain.

Milestones: 
- Identify the current build process: This milestone involves assessing the current build process, including the tools 
and techniques being used, and identifying any inefficiencies or pain points in the process.
- Run end-to-end testing: This milestone involves running end-to-end testing of the automated build process, including 
- testing the build process for different environments and scenarios.

Constraints: 
- Lack of expertise or knowledge: One of the biggest constraints for automating the build process may be a lack of 
expertise or knowledge about the tools and techniques required for automation. This may require training or 
hiring new team members with the necessary skills and experience.
- Budget constraints: Automating the build process may require investment in new tools, software, and hardware, which 
may be constrained by budget limitations. This may require prioritizing which parts of the build process to automate 
first, based on their impact on the overall development process.

Assumptions: 
- Availability of automation tools: One assumption for automating the build process is that the necessary 
automation tools are available and accessible to the development team. This may include build automation tools, 
testing frameworks, and other related tools.
- Availability of resources: Automating the build process may require additional resources, such as time, budget, and 
personnel. An assumption is that these resources are available and can be allocated to the automation initiative as 
needed.

Risks: 
- Integration issues: Automating the build process may require integrating new automation tools with existing systems 
and processes, which can lead to integration issues. These issues may include compatibility issues, communication 
breakdowns between different tools and systems, or unexpected changes in workflow.
- Security risks: Automating the build process can also introduce security risks, particularly if there are 
- vulnerabilities in the automation tools or if the automation process is not properly secured. This can lead to data 
- breaches or other security incidents.

Dependencies: 
- Expertise and knowledge: Automating the build process requires expertise and knowledge in automation techniques and 
tools. This may require hiring additional personnel with the necessary skills and experience or providing training to 
existing team members.
- Integration with existing systems and processes: Automating the build process may require integration with existing 
systems and processes used by the development team. This may include integrating with source code repositories, issue 
tracking systems, and other tools used in the development process


Team: 
- Quality Assurance Engineer: The Quality Assurance Engineer is responsible for testing and verifying the build and 
deployment process to ensure that it meets quality standards and performance requirements.
- DevOps Engineer: The DevOps Engineer is responsible for designing, implementing, and maintaining the automation 
- infrastructure, tools, and processes that support the build and deployment process.
