"Define the Build Process"

Description: 
-  This epic involves defining the build process for the organization's software development projects. The build 
process includes the steps and procedures for compiling, building, packaging, and testing the software code, as well 
as the tools, technologies, and standards that are used in the process. The goal of this epic is to ensure that the 
build process is efficient, reliable, and scalable, and that it meets the requirements and goals of the organization.



Goals: 
- Ensure that the build process is standardized and consistent across the development team, so that everyone is 
following the same procedures and using the same tools and technologies.
- Improve the speed and efficiency of the build process, by identifying and eliminating bottlenecks or manual 
steps where possible.

User Stories: 
- "As a software developer, I want to know the steps and procedures for building and packaging my code, so that I can 
ensure that my code is compiled and packaged correctly."

Dependencies: 
- Availability of the necessary build tools and technologies, such as compilers, packaging tools, and build servers.

Risks: 
- Incompatibility or instability of the build tools and technologies with the project requirements, leading to build failures or poor performance.

Estimated Effort: 
- Overall, the estimated time for defining the build process can range from 6-12 weeks depending on the 
factors mentioned above. It's important to note that this is just an estimate and actual timeframes may vary 
based on the specific needs and requirements of the project.

Business Value:
- Overall, a well-defined build process can help organizations to deliver higher quality products more quickly and 
efficiently, while reducing costs and improving collaboration among team members. This can bring significant business 
value and help organizations to stay competitive in today's fast-paced market.

Priority: 
- Overall, the priority for defining the build process should be determined based on the specific needs of the project 
and the potential impact on development time, quality, and efficiency.
