"Create Automated Build Scripts"

Description: 
- The goal of this epic is to automate the build process by creating scripts that will compile the code, run tests, and 
package the application for deployment.

Goals: 
- Efficiency: Automating the build process can save time and effort by reducing the need for manual intervention.

- Consistency: An automated build script can ensure that the build process is carried out in a consistent and 
- predictable manner across different environments.

- Scalability: An automated build script can be easily adapted to accommodate changes in the project or codebase, 
making it easier to scale up the build process as needed.

User Stories: 
- As a software developer, I want to have an automated build script, so that I can save time and ensure consistency in
the build process across different environments.

Dependencies: 
- A clear understanding of the project architecture and components
- Access to appropriate build tools and packages
- Integration with a continuous integration and delivery platform, such as Jenkins or TravisCI

Risks: 
- Build scripts may need to be updated frequently to reflect changes in the codebase or requirements of the project
- Inadequate testing or quality checks in the build process could lead to bugs and errors in the application
- Integration with continuous integration and delivery platforms may introduce additional complexity or require additional configuration

Estimated Effort: 
-The time required to complete this epic will depend on the size and complexity of the project, the number of 
components that need to be built, and the level of automation required. It could take anywhere from several days to 
several weeks.

Business Value: 
- Automating the build process can improve the speed and quality of software development by reducing the potential for
human error, ensuring consistency across builds, and streamlining the deployment process. This can lead to faster 
time to market, improved customer satisfaction, and increased revenue for the business

Priority: The priority for this epic should be high, as automating the build process can have a significant impact on 
the efficiency and quality of software development. It should be done early in the development process to ensure that 
all subsequent builds are consistent and reliable.
