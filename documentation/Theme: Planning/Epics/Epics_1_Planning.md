"Optimize App Loading Speed"

Description: 
- The objective of this initiative is to improve the loading speed of the mobile app by optimizing the app's code 
and reducing load times for all features and content. This will be achieved by conducting an analysis of the app's 
performance and implementing performance optimizations to reduce load times and improve user experience.

Goals: 
- Increase user retention and loyalty by reducing user frustration with slow loading times
- Increase app usage and revenue by reducing the likelihood of users abandoning the app due to slow load times

- Consistency: An automated build script can ensure that the build process is carried out in a consistent and 
- predictable manner across different environments.

- Scalability: An automated build script can be easily adapted to accommodate changes in the project or codebase, 
making it easier to scale up the build process as needed.

User Stories: 
- As a user, I want the app to load quickly so that I can quickly access my desired features and content without 
any delay.

Dependencies: 
- A clear understanding of the project architecture and components
- Access to appropriate build tools and packages
- Integration with a continuous integration and delivery platform, such as Jenkins or TravisCI

Risks: 
- Optimization changes may introduce new bugs or issues
- Performance optimizations may require significant code changes or refactoring, which can be time-consuming and 
resource-intensive

Estimated Effort: 
- Conducting performance analysis: 1-2 weeks
- Implementing performance optimizations: 4-8 weeks

Business Value: 
- Improving app loading speed can increase user engagement and satisfaction, which can lead to increased user retention 
and loyalty, and ultimately, increased revenue.

Priority: 
- High priority, as slow app loading times can significantly impact user experience and can lead to user 
frustration and abandonment.
