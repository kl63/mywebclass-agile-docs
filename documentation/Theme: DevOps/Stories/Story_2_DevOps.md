" As a software developer, I want to have an automated build script, so that I can save time and ensure consistency in
the build process across different environments."
Acceptance Criteria:

- The automated build script must be able to compile and package the code into a deployable artifact.
- The build script must be version-controlled and stored in the source code repository.
- The build script must be platform-agnostic and work across different operating systems.
- The build script must be able to run all necessary tests before packaging the code.
- The build script must be able to handle any necessary environment configurations, such as database connections or API keys.
